# Hit-or-Fall
## Game theme: delay the inevitable
### Initial idea:
<p>An object (could be anything) is falling to the ground, where the player is located (i.e. a plane).<br>
If the player is crushed by said object, the game is over.<br>
In order to avoid this, the player has to do:<br>
Click on a target (TBD), which would grant them more time from being crushed.<br>
<i>Another idea could be that there are multiple targets, which would grant different amounts of surviving time to the player.</i><br>
<i>E.g. a standard target would add to the y axis by approx. 5 units, and so on.</i><br>

A catch would be that the targets move towards the player, and when they get behind the camera, they disappear and make the falling object come closer to the camera.<br>

<strike>A catch to this, however, would be a target that grants the opposite (reduces time until the player is crushed)</strike><br>
<strike>This target's appearance would entice the player to click it, in order to incorporate the player's focus into the game without aimlessly clicking.</strike><br>

Based off of these targets, the player would have a scoreboard, which would later save the player's top 3 scores.
Scoring would work like this:
<ol>Large target: 5 points</ol>
<ol>Medium target: 3 points</ol>
<ol>Small target: 1 point</ol>
<ol>Enemy target: -3 points</ol>
</p>
